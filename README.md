# 3D Snake Game with Three.js

![SnakeGame](Assets/ScreenShot.png)

## 🎮 Description
A modern implementation of the classic Snake game using Three.js, featuring 3D graphics, dynamic lighting, and interactive camera controls. This project demonstrates the use of 3D rendering, mesh manipulation, and real-time game physics in a web environment.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- JavaScript for game logic
- HTML5 & CSS3 for structure and styling
- WebGL for hardware-accelerated graphics

## 🚀 Features
- 3D environment with dynamic lighting and shadows
- Interactive camera controls (rotate, pan, zoom)
- Smooth snake movement and collision detection
- Score tracking system
- Responsive design

## 🎯 How to Play
- Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction
- Collect food to grow the snake
- Avoid collisions with walls and the snake's body
- Use mouse controls to adjust the camera view:
  - Left click + drag to rotate
  - Right click + drag to pan
  - Scroll to zoom

## 💻 Local Development
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
